# **Project 3: notebooks**

This folder contains notebooks and resources for **Project 3**, where we reconstruct surface ocean pCO₂ from sparse observations using Earth System Model (ESM) outputs and machine learning techniques.

- **`data_story_final_project3.ipynb`**  
  Main notebook for running ML training and evaluation on pre-selected ESMs and members using preprocessed inputs. Recommended for most users seeking an efficient workflow.



- **Contribution Statement**
  - Sungjoon Park:
    - Led the evaluation of ensemble model performance in the ENSO region, with a focus on seasonal variation in surface pCO₂ reconstruction.
    - Through spatial diagnostics of RMSE, bias, and correlation across ensemble members and seasons, identified systematic over- and under-estimations tied to upwelling dynamics and ENSO-driven variability.
    - Highlighted the role of seasonal biases—especially during DJF and JJA—in shaping regional reconstruction accuracy.
    - Additionally, finalized the compilation of the full data story document, synthesizing findings into a cohesive narrative.
